 * Description:
 * This file contains the declaration of functions for communication status checking and LED alarm control.
 *
 * These functions are designed to:
 * - `checkComStatus`: Check communication status within a specified time interval. It triggers an alarm if communication is not established.
 * - `setComAlarm`: Set up an alarm LED to blink at a specified interval to indicate a communication issue.
 *
